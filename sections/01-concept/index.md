# Concept

**Fractal Zoomer** is an interactive desktop and web application that allows users to explore fractal images with infinite zoom capabilities.

### Product Type
- Application with a graphical user interface (both web and desktop versions).

### Use Cases
- **Users**: Students, researchers, and hobbyists interested in fractals and mathematical visualization.
- **Interaction Frequency**: Users typically interact with the system during study sessions or recreational exploration, ranging from a few minutes to hours.
- **Interaction Devices**: Mainly desktop or laptop computers with mouse and keyboard, but the web version supports touch navigation on tablets.
- **Data Storage**: The system does not store user data persistently. User-generated images can be exported locally, but no user data is saved on the server.

### User Roles
- **Explorer**: Navigates and zooms into fractals, customizes parameters, and exports images.
- **Researcher**: Uses advanced customization options for fractal parameters to analyze mathematical properties.
