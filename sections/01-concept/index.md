# Concept

Here you should explain:
- The type of product developed with that project, for example (non-exhaustive):
    - Application (with GUI, be it mobile, web, or desktop)
    - Command-line application (CLI could be used by humans or scripts)
    - Library
    - Web-service(s)
    - Data processing toolkit (= Library + CLI, or Jupyter Notebook)

- Use case collection
    - Where are the users?
    - When and how frequently do they interact with the system?
    - How do they interact with the system? Which devices are they using?
    - Does the system need to store user's data? Which data? Where?
    - Most likely, there will be multiple roles.
