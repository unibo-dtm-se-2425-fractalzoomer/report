# Concept

## Project Vision

The Fractal Zoomer is an interactive desktop application that enables users to explore the mathematical fractal geometry through real-time visualization and navigation. The application provides an intuitive interface for zooming into and panning across three classic fractals: the Mandelbrot set, Julia sets, and the Burning Ship fractal.

## Project Goals
- Create an accessible tool for exploring mathematical fractals
- Provide real-time, interactive fractal rendering
- Support multiple fractal types with seamless switching
- Deliver smooth zoom and pan interactions

## Target Audience

### Primary Users
- **Students**: Learning about complex numbers, recursion, and computational mathematics
- **Educators**: Teaching fractal geometry and chaos theory in classrooms

### Secondary Users
- **Developers**: Learning NumPy-based numerical computing and GUI development
- **Researchers**: Quick fractal visualization for mathematical exploration

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful when:
1. Launch Performance: Application starts and renders initial fractal within 2 seconds
2. Zoom Depth: Users can zoom at least 15 levels deep with maintained visual detail
3. Response Time: Pan and zoom operations respond within 1 second
4. Fractal Switching: Seamless transition between all three fractal types
5. Hardware Requirements: Runs smoothly on standard hardware
