## Abstract

Fractalzoomer is a desktop application built in python with NumPy, pillow and tkinter that allows users to explore and visualize fractals in real time. Users can explore three different set: Mandelbrot, Julia and Burning ship using mouse and keyboard to zoom and pan through the plane. The application features adjustable iteration depth, Julia set parameter customization with preset configurations, and image export functionality with embedded metadata. Fractals computations are optimizied for performance, leveraging on NumPy's vectorized array operations for responsiveness. The aim of the application is to provide visually engaging and interactive experience for exploring the mathematical world of fractals. Fractals are geometric shapes containing detailed structure at arbitrarily small scales; patterns that reflect the structure of the whole can be seen when zooming into any area. The application runs on Windows, macOS and Linux, making it accessible to a wide audience of users, considered also the platform-specific adjustments implemented like different mouse buttons and shortcut keys for trackpad users.

### Technology Stack

- Python 3.11–3.13: Modern Python with full type hint support.
- NumPy: Vectorized array operations for efficient fractal computation.
- Pillow (PIL): Image creation and export functionality.
- Tkinter: Cross-platform GUI framework included in Python's standard library.
- Poetry: Dependency management and packaging.
- pytest: Testing framework with coverage reporting. Readable and fast to write tests.

## Disclaimer (if needed)

During the preparation of this work, the author(s) used **Opus 4.5** to assist with best practice recommendations, coding some features and help in finding tests applicable to a TDD approach. Moreover, **Perplexity** Was implemented to make research on some technical aspects of the process, to find code snippets for specific functionalities and suggestions on the structure of the project. Lastly, UML diagrams were created using **PlantUML** and the relative images available in the section `sections/03-design/images/` path.
